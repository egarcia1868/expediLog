Untitled Project

Intro page, with demo, instructions, introduction and login.

app to look at world map to add points of interest-places.

We'll need to find an api that will give us a lat and long from an address.  (mapquest)(open geocoding)()

I need to set up a jaws db for our project

we would want a way to sort out a single person's posts as well as a way to see all posts about a specific post.

HOME PAGE (welcome.html):

                                  <user login>

"Welcome to expediLog!"
<search user> <search location> <search post>



VIEWER PAGE (viewer.handlebars):

Maybe a choice of:
POST PAGE     /     MAP PAGE

Post page would have a cascading list of posts (to be organized by newest?oldest?month?location?)
Map page would have a map of pins of places visited.



ideas:

"search for" bar at top
  author
  location
  post title

login form in the top bar
